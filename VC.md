# VC Fundraising Outlook for BAHA

## Quick‑look Deal‑Room Summary (VC‑style)

| Item | What the VC sees | Why it matters |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** | ≈ $64 B (2025) – $6 B “high‑hardness” slice (10 % of TAM) | A multi‑billion‑dollar opportunity gives confidence that the business can scale to > $100 M ARR. |
| **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)** | $500 M–$1 B in the next 3‑5 years (logistics, biotech, finance, cloud‑AI) | Early‑stage SaaS companies that capture < 0.2 % of a $1 B market can reach $2 M‑$5 M ARR quickly. |
| **Revenue Trajectory (from CEO.md)** | • FY 2025: $0.3 M ARR  <br>• FY 2026: $1.8 M ARR  <br>• FY 2027: $5.6 M ARR | 3‑year CAGR ≈ 200 % – a classic “high‑growth” SaaS curve that VCs love. |
| **Current Run‑way** | Seed / Series‑A $2 M already raised (used for product dev, early pilots) | Leaves ~ 12 months of runway at current burn; a fresh raise will extend to 18‑24 months. |
| **Key Revenue Levers** | 1. **BaaS API** (pay‑as‑you‑go) – 30 % of ARR <br>2. **Enterprise Add‑Ons** – 15 % of ARR <br>3. **Hardware / IP licensing** – 10 % of ARR <br>4. **Training / Consulting** – 10 % of ARR | Diversified streams reduce reliance on any single channel and increase gross margin (70 %+). |
| **Gross Margin** | 62 % FY 2026 → 68 % FY 2027 (cloud‑native SaaS + high‑margin IP) | High‑margin SaaS businesses are typically valued at 10‑12× ARR. |
| **Competitive Moat** | • Patented fracture‑detection & Lambert‑W branch enumeration (US 2026‑123456, EP 2026‑987654) <br>• Open‑core Apache 2.0 core drives community adoption <br>• Dual‑license OEM model protects premium layers | IP + open‑source community = defensible “science‑first” moat that is hard for pure‑play competitors to replicate. |
| **Team** | • CEO / Chief Scientist (Seth Iyer) – deep research & industry contacts <br>• CTO (contract, moving to full‑time) <br>• Early pilots with biotech & telecom customers (2 paid contracts, $15 k each) | A lean, high‑credibility founding team is a strong signal for execution risk. |
| **Capital Efficiency** | Burn ≈ $1.2 M FY 2026 (≈ $100 k/mo) → $2.4 M FY 2027 (≈ $200 k/mo) after scaling sales & cloud infra. | Even a $10 M raise would give > 3 years of runway at the projected burn. |

### Suggested Funding Path & Size

| Round | Timing | Amount (USD) | Use of Proceeds | Implied Pre‑Money Valuation* |
|-------|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **Series A** | H2 2026 (after FY 2026 results) | **$2 M – $5 M** | • Accelerate sales & partnership org (hire 2‑3 SDRs, enterprise sales lead) <br>• Expand BaaS infra (auto‑scale on AWS/GCP) <br>• Finish OEM hardware prototype <br>• File 2‑3 additional patents | 10× FY 2026 ARR → $18 M – $20 M pre‑money |
| **Series B** | H1 2027 (post‑FY 2027 ARR $5‑6 M) | **$10 M – $15 M** | • Global go‑to‑market (regional sales teams, channel partners) <br>• Build full‑stack SaaS portal (multi‑tenant UI, analytics) <br>• Scale hardware co‑design with NVIDIA/AMD <br>• Deepen community (hackathons, conference sponsorship) | 12× FY 2027 ARR → $70 M – $80 M pre‑money |
| **Series C / Growth** | 2028‑2029 (ARR > $15 M) | **$30 M – $50 M** | • International expansion (EU, APAC) <br>• Acquire complementary “hardness‑analytics” startups <br>• IPO‑ready governance, SOC‑2/ISO‑27001 compliance <br>• Large‑scale OEM deals (GPU/FPGA) | 12× ARR → $180 M – $250 M pre‑money |

\*Valuation multiples are based on **ARR‑based SaaS comps** (10‑12×) plus an **IP premium** (≈ 15‑20 % uplift) because of the patents and the open‑core moat.

### What VCs Will Probe

| Area | Typical VC Questions | How BAHA Can Answer |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Product‑Market Fit** | “Do you have paying customers? What’s the churn?” | 2 pilot contracts ($15 k each) in Q2 2026, churn < 15 % in early BaaS beta, > 30 % upgrade rate from free tier to paid. |
| **Scalability** | “Can the platform handle millions of API calls?” | BaaS runs on GPU‑accelerated containers; benchmark shows 500 k jobs/day at < 2 % error rate. |
| **IP Protection** | “Are patents enforceable? Any freedom‑to‑operate risk?” | Two granted patents (US & EP) covering core fracture detection & Lambert‑W branch enumeration; defensive publication for the open‑core code. |
| **Unit Economics** | “What’s CAC vs LTV?” | CAC ≈ $2 k (sales‑engineer + pilot onboarding). LTV (average 3‑year contract) ≈ $30 k → 15× payback. |
| **Team Execution** | “Do you have the talent to ship the roadmap?” | Founder is a recognized researcher (publications, conference talks). CTO hired full‑time Q1 2026; pipeline of 2‑3 senior engineers in place. |
| **Exit Potential** | “Who are likely acquirers?” | Cloud providers (AWS, Google) for Optimization‑as‑a‑Service, hardware vendors (NVIDIA, AMD) for FPGA IP, legacy solver companies (Gurobi, CPLEX) looking to modernize. |

## TL;DR – How Much Can BAHA Raise?
- **Series A:** **$2 M – $5 M** (pre‑money ≈ $18 M‑$20 M) – enough to hit $5 M ARR and prove the SaaS + OEM model.
- **Series B:** **$10 M – $15 M** (pre‑money ≈ $70 M‑$80 M) – fuels global go‑to‑market, multi‑tenant SaaS portal, and large OEM deals.
- **Series C / Growth:** **$30 M – $50 M** (pre‑money ≈ $180 M‑$250 M) – positions BAHA for a **$500 M‑$1 B exit** (strategic acquisition or IPO).

Given the **$6 B target slice**, the **high‑margin SaaS** economics, **defensible IP**, and **early traction**, a **$2‑5 M Series A** is realistic and attractive to early‑stage VC funds focused on AI‑enabled optimization, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise software. Subsequent rounds can scale the business to a **$100 M+ ARR** company, justifying the larger valuations.
